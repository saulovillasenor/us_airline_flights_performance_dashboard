## Components of the report items
1. __Yearly airline performance report__. For the chosen year provide:
	- Number of flights under different cancellation categories using bar chart.
	- Average flight time by reporting airline using line chart.
	- Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline using pie chart.
	- Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth map.
	- Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline using treemap chart.
2. __Yearly average flight delay statistics__. For the chosen year provide:

	- Create two HTML divisions that can accomodate two components (in one division) side by side. One is HTML heading and the other one is dropdown.
	- Add graph components.
	- Callback function to compute data, create graph and return to the layout.

## Review
Search/Look for review to know how commands are used and computations are carried out. There are 7 review items.
- REVIEW1: Clear the layout and do not display exception till callback gets executed.
- REVIEW2: Dropdown creation.
- REVIEW3: Observe how we add an empty division and providing an id that will be updated during callback.
- REVIEW4: Holding output state till user enters all the form information. In this case, it will be chart type and year.
- REVIEW5: Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth
- REVIEW6: Return dcc.Graph component to the empty division
- REVIEW7: This covers chart type 2 and we have completed this exercise under Flight Delay Time Statistics Dashboard section
